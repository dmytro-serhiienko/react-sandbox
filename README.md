# 🧪 React Practice Sandbox

My personal playground for learning **React** and modern frontend development tools. Here I experiment with hooks, component architecture, and integration of various libraries.

🚀 **Live Demo:**  
https://react-sandbox-azure.vercel.app/

## 🎯 Implemented Features

In this project, I practice the following concepts:

- **Hooks:** Working with `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and creating custom hooks.
- **Reusable Components:** Building flexible and maintainable UI components.
- **Routing:** Navigation between pages (if using React Router).
- **API Fetching:** Handling asynchronous data, loading states, and error management.
- **Forms & Validation:** Controlled components and form validation techniques.
